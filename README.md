# WebCrawlZ
WebCrawlZ is a simple web crawler tool that scans a website for all anchor (`&lt;a>`) tags and prints their `href` attributes. It is built using Python and utilizes the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `fake-useragent` libraries for web scraping and user agent spoofing. Additionally, it uses the `art` library for ASCII art.
